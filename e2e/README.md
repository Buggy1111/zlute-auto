## Test Execution

Tests run on **5 different configurations**:

2. Desktop Firefox (1280x720)
3. Desktop Safari (1280x720)
4. Mobile Chrome (Pixel 5)
5. Mobile Safari (iPhone 12)

**Total test runs**: 71 tests Ã— 5 configurations = **355 test executions** per full run

## Running Tests

See parent directory documentation:
- `E2E_QUICKSTART.md` - Quick start guide
- `E2E_TESTING.md` - Comprehensive documentation

Quick command:
```bash
npm run test:e2e:ui
```

## Test Naming Convention

Tests follow this pattern:
```typescript
test.describe('Feature Name', () => {
  test('should do something specific', async ({ page }) => {
    // test code
  });
});
```

## Adding New Tests

1. Create a new `.spec.ts` file or add to existing one
2. Import helpers: `import { startGame, addPoint } from './helpers'`
3. Write test using Playwright API
4. Run in UI mode to verify: `npm run test:e2e:ui`
5. Update this README with new test count

## Test Quality Standards

- âœ… Each test is independent (no shared state)
- âœ… Tests use unique player names
- âœ… Proper waiting for Firebase updates (2-2.5s delays)
- âœ… Clear test descriptions
- âœ… Both happy path and error cases covered
- âœ… Mobile and desktop viewports tested
- âœ… Accessibility considered

## Firebase Considerations

These tests interact with **real Firebase Firestore**:
- Each test creates actual game documents
- Games persist after test completion
- Use unique player names to avoid conflicts
- Sequential execution (1 worker) prevents race conditions
- Consider periodic Firebase cleanup of test data

## Maintenance

Update tests when:
- UI components change
- New features are added
- Existing features are modified
- Firebase structure changes
- Accessibility requirements change

Keep test count and coverage updated in this README.
