## How to Run Tests

### First Time Setup

1. **Install Playwright browsers:**
```bash
cd C:\Users\micha\OneDrive\Plocha\žlute_auto\zlute-auto
npm run playwright:install
```

This downloads Chrome, Firefox, and Safari browsers (~500MB).

### Running Tests

#### Recommended: UI Mode (Interactive)
```bash
npm run test:e2e:ui
```

Opens interactive UI where you can:
- See all tests
- Run individual tests
- Watch execution in real-time
- Debug failures visually
- Time-travel through test steps

#### Quick Test (Headless)
```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

Runs all tests in headless mode. Fast, no browser windows.

#### Watch Tests Execute
```bash
npm run test:e2e:headed
```

Opens browser windows so you can see tests run.

#### Debug Tests
```bash
npm run test:e2e:debug
```

Opens Playwright Inspector for step-by-step debugging.

#### Browser-Specific
```bash
npm run test:e2e:chrome   # Chrome only
npm run test:e2e:firefox  # Firefox only
npm run test:e2e:safari   # Safari only
npm run test:e2e:mobile   # Mobile viewports only
```

#### View Results
```bash
npm run test:e2e:report
```

Opens HTML report with screenshots, videos, and detailed results.

## Important Notes

### Firebase Integration

⚠️ **These tests use REAL Firebase Firestore**

- Tests create actual game documents in your Firebase project
- Each test uses unique player names to avoid conflicts
- Games persist after tests complete
- Sequential execution (1 worker) prevents race conditions
- Consider periodic cleanup of test games in Firebase

**Environment Variables Required:**
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`
- All other Firebase config variables

Make sure `.env.local` is properly configured before running tests.

### Test Execution Time

- **Single test:** 5-15 seconds
- **Full suite (one browser):** 3-5 minutes
- **Full suite (all browsers):** 10-15 minutes
- **Mobile tests only:** 2-3 minutes

### Best Practices

1. **Use UI Mode for Development**
   - `npm run test:e2e:ui` is the best way to write and debug tests

2. **Run Before Committing**
   - `npm run test:e2e:chrome` for quick validation
   - `npm run test:e2e` for full validation

3. **Unique Player Names**
   - Each test uses unique names to avoid Firebase conflicts
   - Don't reuse the same names across tests

4. **Wait for Firebase**
   - Tests include proper delays (2-2.5s) for Firebase sync
   - Don't reduce these delays or tests may become flaky

---

## Next Steps

### 1. Install Browsers (Required)
```bash
npm run playwright:install
```

### 2. Run Your First Test
```bash
npm run test:e2e:ui
```

This opens the UI where you can explore all tests.

### 3. Read Documentation
- Quick start: `E2E_QUICKSTART.md`
- Full guide: `E2E_TESTING.md`
- Test details: `e2e/README.md`

### 4. (Optional) VSCode Extension
Install [Playwright VSCode Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-playwright.playwright) for:
- Running tests from VSCode
- Debugging with breakpoints
- Test explorer in sidebar

### 5. Set Up CI/CD (Optional)
Add GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing on push/PR. Example in `E2E_TESTING.md`.

## Testing the Navigation Deep Links

The test suite includes comprehensive tests for the navigation modal feature we just fixed, including:

1. **Opening the modal** - Tests that modal opens from game menu
2. **All navigation apps** - Google Maps, Waze, Mapy.cz, Apple Maps
3. **Deep link functionality** - Tests that clicks trigger navigation
4. **Instructions** - Verifies all instruction sections are visible
5. **Android tips** - Split-screen tip display
6. **Wake lock info** - Screen wake lock information
7. **Modal closing** - Both button and backdrop clicks
8. **State preservation** - Game state unchanged after modal use
9. **Mobile compatibility** - Tests on mobile viewports

These tests ensure the deep link functionality works correctly on both desktop and mobile.

## Maintenance

### Updating Tests

When you modify the application:

1. **UI Changes** - Update selectors in test files
2. **New Features** - Add new tests in appropriate spec file
3. **Bug Fixes** - Add regression tests
4. **Firebase Changes** - Update helpers and wait times

### Keeping Tests Healthy

```bash
# Update Playwright
npm install -D @playwright/test@latest

# Update browsers
npm run playwright:install

# Run tests regularly
npm run test:e2e
```

### Debugging Failures

1. Run in UI mode: `npm run test:e2e:ui`
2. Click on failed test
3. Watch it execute
4. Check screenshots in report
5. Update test or fix bug
